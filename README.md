# Computer-System-Design

Repo for my projects for Computer System Design Class.
In this class we explored computer system design and prototyping using a very famous HDL: **Verilog**

ISE Design Suite was used to develop the projects, which were design to run in a *ZedBoard* FPGA board.

Projects Included:
  * ALU - Behavioral Description -- 1/31/2021
  * ALU - Structural Description -- 1/31/2021
  * BCD Programmable Counter     -- 2/7/2021
